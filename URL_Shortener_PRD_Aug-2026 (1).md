# Product Requirements Document: LinkSnip
## URL Shortening Service

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Date:** Aug 21, 2026

---

## 1. Overview

LinkSnip is a web-based URL shortening service that converts long URLs into short, shareable links. It provides click analytics, custom aliases, and link management for individual users and businesses.

## 2. Problem Statement

Long URLs are hard to share, especially on character-limited platforms, in print, or verbally. Users also lack visibility into how their shared links perform (clicks, geography, referrers).

## 3. Target Users

- **Casual users** — sharing links on social media, messaging
- **Marketers** — tracking campaign performance via click data

## 4. User Stories (MVP)

1. As a visitor, I can paste a long URL and get a shortened link instantly, no login required.
2. As a registered user, I can create a custom alias (e.g., `lnk.to/my-sale`).
3. As a user, I can view click count, timestamp, referrer, device, and location for each link.
4. As a user, I can edit the destination URL of a link I own without changing the short link.
5. As a user, I can organize links into folders/tags.
6. As a user, I can set a link to expire after a date or click count.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Core Shortening
- Accept any valid URL; generate a unique short code (default 6–7 chars, base62).
- Support custom aliases (3–30 chars, alphanumeric + hyphens), with uniqueness check.
- Reject/flag malicious URLs (malware, phishing) via safe-browsing API check.
- Support bulk link creation (CSV upload) for logged-in users.

### 5.2 Redirection
- Short link resolves via 301/302 redirect (configurable) with < 100ms latency.
- Log click metadata: timestamp, IP-derived geo, referrer, user agent/device, browser.
- Handle expired/disabled links with a friendly error page.

### 5.3 Account & Auth
- Password reset, email verification.

### 5.4 Dashboard & Analytics
- List view of all user's links with search/filter/sort.
- Per-link analytics: clicks over time (chart), top referrers, geography, device breakdown.
- Export analytics as CSV.

### 5.5 Link Management
- Edit destination URL, alias, expiration, tags/folders.
- QR code generation per link.
- Password-protect a link (optional).
- Bulk delete/archive.

### 5.6 API
- REST endpoints: create, read, update, delete links; fetch analytics.
- Rate-limited to prevent abuse.
- API documentation (OpenAPI spec).

## 6. Technical Considerations (High-Level)

- Short-code generation: base62 encoding of an auto-increment ID or hash-based approach with collision checks.
- Redirect service decoupled from dashboard/API for independent scaling; consider read-through cache (Redis) in front of the datastore.
- Click event ingestion via async queue (avoid blocking redirect on analytics write).
- Data store: relational DB for links/users (e.g., Postgres); time-series/analytics store for click events.
